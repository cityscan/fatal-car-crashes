![Illinois Road Deaths Sign](roadsign.jpg)

You may have seen a sign like the one pictured above while on the highway in Illinois, displaying how many deaths there have been on the road. The sign above says there had been 957 traffic deaths in 2012. That number is scary, but what does it really mean? Where did they happen and under what conditions? Besides avoiding texting while driving, what else should I be watching out for?

As a non-driver myself, and feeling pressure from family to get my driver's license, I feel all the more sensitive to statistics like this. I don't drive precisely because of the risk of accidents. If we were all driving bouncy bubble cars, I would have gotten my license many years ago. I'm still considering getting my license anyway and I'd feel a lot better if I could pinpoint where the really awful accidents happened.

I want to see a map with positions of the accidents overlaid, and I want to see how that changes over time. I'm using data from the [Fatality Analysis Reporting System](http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Main/index.aspx) provided by the [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](http://www.nhtsa.gov/). Please see [this repository's wiki](https://github.com/tothebeat/fatal-car-crashes/wiki/Data-Sources) for more information.
